# ScheduleSwift
CS307 Semester Project

# Imporant Nodes
* Please make sure you have node.js installed on your computer before attempting to run this or it will not work
* Please make sure you have a .gitignore file in the highest level of your local cloned repository. Within that file, just type /node_modules so that when you commit to the repo it doesn't send all the node module files too.

# Running React App
* cd scheduleswift
* npm start

# Installed Module
* run npm i to install all modules in the package.json
* note there is an package.json is both the server folder and the scheduleswift folder
