# ScheduleSwift
CS307 Semester Project


# Important Notes
Static contains the login and index pages for our project so far
Server is the backend for our project
Node_Modules was auto populated by installing Node, Express, and Nodemon. You will not need to install these if you clone the repo.

# Login
I added a System Administrator Login, which will bypass account authentication when that is implemented
* Username: sysadmin
* Password: sys1234


# Running the Server
To start the server, use "nodemon server.js" in your terminal. Nodemon makes it so you don't have to restart the server every time you change server.js, you can just refresh the webpage. Currently, the port is hardcoded as port 3001, so to access the webpage, go to localhost:3001
